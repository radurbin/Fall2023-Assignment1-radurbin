<!-- INSTRUCTIONS:
✓ Find a movie or TV series that you are a fan of and employ the following HTML/CSS features:
✓ A background color for the entire page of your choosing.
- A div containing:

✓ An h1 element with an ID of 'Title'.
✓ An img element related to the media with and ID of 'CoverArt' (Cover art is good here). This image should be circular/have rounded edges.
✓ An h5 element with an ID of 'Rating'. This should be the rating from IMDB out of 10.
- An iframe embedding a youtube video of a trailer of the media with an ID of 'Trailer'. This can be acquired by right clicking on the video, and copying the embed.

- An <a> element linking to the IMDB page.
- The summary text from IMDB in a Paragraph element with an ID of 'Summary'.
- Unordered list of three to five actors. This unorder list element should have an ID of 'Actors'.

- All content on the page should be centered.
- Color all text on the page in a contrasting color to the one you picked for the background.
- It is best to take this little pieces at a time, step by step, as not to get confused by too many things at once. W3 Schools is an amazing resource, and has examples on everything above if you get stuck.
- Feel free to get creative and add additional features after base requirements have been met.
- Publishing the app is a key requirement of the assignment. -->
